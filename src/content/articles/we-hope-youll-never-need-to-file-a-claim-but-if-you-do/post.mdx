**No one ever expects to get in a car accident. But the facts speak for themselves and they are alarming.**

It is unsettling to think that even though auto insurance is a requirement for vehicle registration in nearly every U.S. state, 13% of drivers do not have insurance! This statistic makes it even more important for all of the other drivers to have excellent car insurance.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Traffic Safety Facts from 2019 are definitely disturbing.

## Did you know?

- Over 37,000 people die in road accidents each year.

- In 2017, 434 of the 3166 distracted driver fatalities involved cell phones.

- Phone use is a major distraction from driving. On average, it takes most people 5 seconds to take their eyes off the road to read or send a text. At 55 mph, that equates to driving the full length of a football field with your eyes closed.

- Eight percent (271 of 3,255) of drivers 15 to 19 years old involved in fatal crashes were distracted at the time of the crashes.

- 2.35 million are injured or disabled from auto accidents.

- 2 million drivers experience a permanent injury every year.

- Road crashes cost the U.S. $230.6 billion per year or an average of $820 per person.

- There is an average of one alcohol-impaired-driving fatality every 48 minutes.

Knowing all of that is enough to do whatever it takes to keep you and your loved ones safe while on the road, right? Safety is one of the best reasons to make sure your car insurance coverage is current in terms of protection. When buying, be sure to compare auto insurance company rates to make sure your policy is up-to-date.

## How to Buy Car Insurance that Works Hard for You

Car insurance is a necessary, but confusing, purchase when it comes right down to it. When you are in the process of buying auto insurance the goal seems to be to find the lowest rate. In actuality, it is more important to get the best coverage for the lowest rate. Some drivers don’t really understand the details of auto insurance policies so they resist spending a few extra minutes comparing auto insurance companies.

## Let’s Make it Simple

Take a few minutes and compare quotes from some of the outstanding car insurance companies that will be personally selected for you when you fill out this mini-form. You will be so happy you did that you will want to tell your friends and family how you got the best deal with little effort.

## Use This Checklist to Compare

✔ Liability Coverage: This coverage protects you from lawsuits that may result from failure to use reasonable care (aka negligence) while driving. It covers bodily injuries and property damage, so you will want to make sure you are covered. If you are injured or if your car is damaged through no fault of your own, it is covered by the other person’s liability coverage.

✔ Physical Damage Coverage: If you cause an accident and damage your own car, collision and comprehensive coverage will help pay for the damage. There is always a deductible that you must pay, but you have choices. Some of the more commonly selected deductibles are $100, $250 and $500. The higher the deductible, the more out-of-pocket you will have to pay against the cost of repair. As an example, a $1,000 deductible would reduce your monthly premium considerably, but you would want to be sure you can afford to pay out \$1,000 should your vehicle become involved in an auto accident.

✔ Car Insurance Discounts: Nearly all auto insurance companies, like GEICO, Progressive and State Farm offer a variety of discounts, such as:

1. Good Driving Record Discount
2. Good Credit Score Discount
3. Anti-Theft Device Discount
4. Multiple Car Discount
5. Annual Low Mileage Discount
6. ZIP code Discount
7. Age 30-65 Discount
8. Homeowner Discount

Most drivers qualify for at least one of the above car insurance discounts, so be sure to include them in your auto insurance quotes comparison.
