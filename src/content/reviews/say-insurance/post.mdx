## In a Nutshell

Say Insurance is Shelter General Insurance Company’s online auto insurance platform. It serves drivers in five states: Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee. Say Insurance stands for clear-cut, simplified, and transparent vehicle insurance. Its website is full of useful tips and tools to help you get the most out of your auto insurance and even earn you a discount or two.

## Pros and Cons

**Pro:** Shelter General created Say Insurance to serve the needs of customers who prefer to shop online. Say says it exists to provide clear-cut insurance, and we’re happy to say that it gets an A+ on this front. Everything about the Say Insurance website is designed to make things easier on the customer. For example, it lets you easily search coverage per vehicle type and location. It provides a detailed list of discounts. And it even has a free tool that shows you how your rate is calculated and what you can do to get a lower rate.

**Con:** The main downside to Say Insurance’s service is that it only serves 5 states. Say Insurance is operated by Shelter General Insurance Company, itself a subsidiary of Shelter Insurance Company, which has been active since 1946 and operates in 15 states. Say Insurance launched in 2016 and currently operates in Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee. We hope Say rolls out its service to include other states in future.

## Types of Auto Insurance

From state minimums to full coverage, Say Insurance has a range of package options for users to choose from. Interestingly, each policy comes with \$100 worth of complimentary roadside assistance. Here are the main types of coverage you can find at Say Insurance.

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers all expenses related to bodily injuries suffered by other drivers when you are at fault. Compulsory in all states where Say Insurance operates.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers all expenses related to damage of another person’s property when you are at fault. Compulsory in all states where Say Insurance operates.

**Collision.** Covers expenses related to vehicle repair and replacement if your vehicle is damaged in a collision, regardless of who was at fault. This coverage is voluntary.

**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement if your vehicle suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal. This coverage is voluntary.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Covers medical and rehabilitation expenses, and in some cases lost wages for you and any other passengers, no matter who was at fault. Compulsory in Kansas, voluntary in the other states where Say Insurance operates.

**Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist.** Covers the other driver’s liabilities if they are uninsured or underinsured. This type of coverage is voluntary. Compulsory in Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, voluntary in Colorado and Tennessee.

## Additional Features

Say Insurance offers most of the common add-ons you can expect from an auto insurance carrier. In addition, it has a bunch of cool features aimed at helping its customers navigate the complicated world of vehicle coverage to get the best deal.

Highlights include:

**Insurance score.** When you apply for insurance, your carrier gives you a score which it then uses to calculate your rate. Most carriers won’t tell you your score, but Say does! With Say Insurance, you learn key factors affecting your score and discover how to improve your score.

**Simplified rates.** Say Insurance has devised a simple way for you to get your quote, letting you search by vehicle type (e.g. manufacturer and model) and location (e.g. state). This reduces the time it takes for you to see your rate.

**Discounts.** Say Insurance is transparent about discount opportunities. Its website contains a page that lists each type of discount and explains what you have to do to qualify for it.

**Eco-friendly.** Say has a strict green policy which includes discounts for customers who opt to go paperless.

**Insurance 101 blog.** The Say Insurance blog contains far more information than you’ll get from the average car insurance company.

## How to Apply

When applying to Say Insurance, you should budget in about 5-10 minutes of your time to get through the whole process. As mentioned, Say Insurance simplifies the application process so that you don’t waste time providing information that doesn’t affect your rate. To begin, just select your location or vehicle type, and then answer some basic questions about you and your driving history.

To purchase insurance from Say Insurance, you will need to provide:

- Driver’s license number for each driver.

- Vehicle identification number (VIN) for each vehicle.

- Information about the finance company you use (if your vehicle is a loan or lease).

## Filing a Claim

Say’s claims process is just as easy to navigate as the application process. To start a claim, you can file online in your MySay dashboard or call Say directly. Either way, you’ll be asked to enter your personal details, Say Insurance policy number, details and description of the incident, and the insurance and contact info of anyone else involved. Best of all, you can check the status of your claim in your MySay dashboard.

According to Say, you’ll be assigned an adjuster who will reach out within one business day of receiving your claim. Most collision and comprehensive claims take about 4-12 days to complete, while medical payment and liability claims may take longer.

## Contact Details

Say offers multiple communications channels and a promise to provide a quick response. According to say, it has a team of about 20 people in its call center, which is based alongside other departments at the company’s Missouri headquarters. Despite having a small team, the average wait time to answer calls is 9 seconds. Say also offers a live chat and Facebook chat option.
