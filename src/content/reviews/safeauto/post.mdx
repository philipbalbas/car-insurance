## In a Nutshell

Founded in 1993, SafeAuto is an auto insurance company serving motorists in 17 states. It is a leader in providing liability coverage that meets each of these states’ minimum required coverage. Residents of participating states may be familiar with SafeAuto through its classic “Minimum Coverage for Minimum Budgets” TV advertising campaign.

## Pros and Cons

The main reason to want to purchase auto insurance from SafeAuto is in order to not spend any more on auto insurance than you’re required to by law. SafeAuto has become a leader in the state-minimum auto-insurance market, providing the minimum level of legally required liability coverage in 17 states. It can also help out with other legal requirements related to your driving obligations, such as SR-22 documentation if a court orders you to provide proof of insurance.

Given its no-frills, low-budget offering, SafeAuto doesn’t offer much in the way of add-ons. While other car insurance companies attract customers with promises of driver rewards and discounts, SafeAuto keeps it simple. This means it’s more simple but also less flexible in its offering – which some drivers will consider a pro and others a con, depending on their perspective.

## Types of Auto Insurance

SafeAuto provides car insurance to motorists in these states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

These types of insurance can be purchased separately in some states:

Liability Insurance. Bodily Injury liability and Property Damage liability, covers expenses for damages you cause to other people or to another person’s vehicle or property when you’re at fault in an accident.Collision and Comprehensive. Covers your and your passenger’s medical expenses and related expenses, such as income loss, when you’re involved in a car accident or your car is damaged by non-collision events such as floods, storms, theft, or vandalism.

Full coverage varies from state to state, but generally includes:

**Liability.**

**Collision and Comprehensive.**

**Roadside assistance.** Includes emergency towing, jump-start, tire replacement, fuel delivery, and locksmith services.

**Uninsured / underinsured motorist protection.** Covers liability when the other driver is at fault but doesn’t have a sufficient level of insurance to cover the liability themselves.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Offered in no-fault states,this covers medical expenses for you and your passengers – regardless of who was at fault. In other states, medicalexpense coverage is offered.

**Rental Reimbursement.** Covers the cost of a rental car while your car is being repaired after an accident.

**Accidental Death Benefit.** Provides a fixed payment to a policy holder’s loved ones if they die as the result of a car accident.

SafeAuto also offers the following services and benefits:

- Discounts for insuring multiple vehicles under one policy, for being a homeowner, or for switching over from another insurance provider.

-SR-22, a certification that shows proof you are carrying the minimum liability coverage required in your state. In some states, an SR-22 is compulsory for people who have previously been involved in an accident without holding the minimum level of car insurance required by law.

## How to Apply

Interested drivers can apply for car insurance online or over the phone. The process is fairly similar to applying to any other insurance provider. SafeAuto will ask for contact details, plus some details about yourself and any other drivers you plan on adding to the policy, your vehicle (or vehicles) and driving behaviour, and information about any existing car insurance coverage.

SafeAuto typically issues mails out your new policy within three working days, but if you need proof of insurance sooner you can request for it to fax or email you your policy. You can get assistance with proof of insurance at any time through the customer service contact channels below.
