## In a Nutshell

Allstate Insurance Company is one of the largest publicly held insurance companies in the United States, servicing 16 million households. It has agents all around the country to advise you on auto insurance as well as other types of insurance and asset protection. Allstate offers a full suite of car insurance products, including collision coverage, comprehensive coverage, and roadside assistance.

## Pros and Cons

One of the biggest benefits of being insured with Allstate is that it offers every type of car insurance imaginable. Therefore, if you wish to start out with one type of policy and add other forms of coverage later on, you can do so through the same provider. Allstate serves all 50 states and DC, with agents around the country to answer any questions, give you a quote, and help you purchase your insurance policy. Another handy feature is its Drivewise program, which rewards policy holders with cashback for allowing Allstate to measure their driving behavior.

Allstate ticks most boxes, but if there is an obvious downside it’s that all its car insurance policies are for 6 months rather than for 12 months. By renewing its customers policies every 6 months, Allstate has 2 opportunities each year to increase rates. Having said that, this doesn’t mean it will increase your rate at every opportunity – only that it has the option of doing so.
