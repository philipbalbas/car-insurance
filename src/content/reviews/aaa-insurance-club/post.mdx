## In a Nutshell

The American Automobile Association (AAA – pronounced “Triple A”) is a federation of 60+ not-for-profit motor clubs throughout the United States and Canada. These clubs are known for offering a range of automotive services such as roadside assistance and driver safety programs. Most AAA clubs offer vehicle coverage through CSAA Insurance Group, which is part of the family of AAA-affiliated companies.

## Pros and Cons

**Pro:** AAA is one of the largest not-for-profit organizations of any type in North America, with more than 58 million members across the United States and Canada. It offers a wide range of automotive services, from roadside assistance to driver safety to insurance. You don’t have to buy car insurance from AAA to become a member, but it certainly is convenient to be able to access all your auto-related services in the one place.

**Con:** Aside from the convenience, there aren’t any obvious benefits to choosing AAA insurance over other insurers. The rates are similar to other large insurance carriers – whether or not you actually get a better offer from AAA depends on your own driving profile and driving record. With that said, it can’t hurt to ask AAA for a quote and find out if you qualify for a good deal.

## Types of Auto Insurance

AAA has dozens of clubs operating in different parts of the United States. Each branch is equipped to offer you vehicle coverage that meets the legal minimum requirements in your state – and broader coverage like comprehensive and collision if you feel like adding those to your policy.

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers all expenses related to bodily injuries suffered by other drivers when you are at fault.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers all expenses related to damage of another person’s property when you are at fault.

**Collision.** Covers expenses related to vehicle repair and replacement if your vehicle is damaged in a collision, regardless of who was at fault.

**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement if your vehicle suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.

**Medical Payments / Personal Injury Protection.** Covers medical and rehabilitation expenses, and in some cases lost wages for you and any passengers, no matter who was at fault.

**Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist.** Covers the other driver’s liabilities if they are uninsured or underinsured.

## Additional Features

AAA offers a small number of paid add-ons that you can tack on to your policy. In addition, most AAA clubs offer their members a range of free automotive services.

**Schedule auto repair.** AAA members get discounts at AAA-owned and AAA-approved auto repair centers.

**Battery service.** AAA Members get free battery testing, delivery and installation when and where you need it.

**DMV services.** For AAA members: if you can’t make it to the DMV to renew your vehicle registration, AAA will take care of it for you.

**Road safety.** Free safety tips, programs and resources for all ages to practice road safety.

**Car sharing.** Many AAA clubs offer paid car sharing services, with fuel, insurance, and parking included.

**Rental reimbursement.** Paid add-on that gives you a rental vehicle in the event of a covered loss on an insured vehicle.

**New car added protection.** Paid add-on that covers repairs or replaces your car without depreciation if it is damaged or totalled in a covered loss.

**Partner discounts.** Discounts vary from AAA club to AAA club. Discounts may include auto-related services like electric vehicle fast charging and battery service, and non-auto services like cheap tickets to events.

## How to Apply

You don’t have to be a member of AAA to apply for auto insurance, although it helps make the process smoother. According to AAA, users save an average of \$393 on bundled auto and home insurance when purchasing the two together. Plus, you get an additional 5% discount on auto insurance when you add life coverage.

The application process is similar to what you’ll find with any other insurance carrier. To get a quote, just fill out the short online form on the website of your local AAA club or call your club to speak to a licensed agent. As with any other insurer, you’ll be asked to provide details about you and your co-applicants, your vehicle(s), and your driving record and claims history.

## Filing a Claim

Each AAA club has its own claims process, although the process is generally similar from club to club. At the very least, you should be able to file a claim online or over the phone. To begin a claim, you will need to provide some quick details about the incident and then wait for a AAA claims representative to get back to you.

## Contact Details

Each AAA club acts as a separate entity under the AAA national brand. Each club has its own phone number and contact channels.

## Summary

AAA is best-known for its roadside services and driver safety programs, but did you know they also provide car insurance? Most AAA clubs provide car insurance through CSAA Insurance, a AAA affiliate. AAA offers vehicle coverage that matches most large providers for price and features. What’s more, as a AAA member, you also get access to a range of cool features you won’t find elsewhere, such as DMV services and auto repair discounts.
