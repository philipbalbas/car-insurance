## In a Nutshell

Advertising Disclosure Farmers Insurance is an insurance industry veteran and one of the largest providers of car insurance in the country, offering a full suite of products to motorists around the country for more than 90 years. It’s still going strong today, offering everything from liability and collision to add-ons like roadside assistance and accident forgiveness. Customers can ask for a quote online or over the phone.

## Pros and Cons

Farmers is in the business of insurance, covering everything from car insurance, to homeowners, renters, business, and life insurance. This is good news for car owners, because it offers rewards to customers who bundle their car insurance in with other types of insurance. But even if car insurance is all you want, Farmers has a full suite of products to choose from – from all the standard types of policies offered by most insurers to several different add-ons that each offer their own rewards.

On the downside, Farmers doesn’t offer car insurance to every state. To find out if your state or location is covered, simply enter your zip code into the online quote tool to see if Farmers can provide you with coverage. If your state isn’t covered, Farmers will suggest a few alternative insurance providers.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Farmers Insurance offers the following types of insurance:

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Legally required in most states. If you’re at fault in a collision, this covers expenses related to other people’s injuries, such as medical bills and income loss.

**Property Damage Liability.** Also compulsory in most states. If you’re at fault, this covers expenses if your vehicle causes damage to another person’s car or to other property such as their fence or house.

**Collision.** If you hit another vehicle or another object, such as a pole, this covers damages to your vehicle.

**Comprehensive.** Covers damage to your vehicle for incidents other than those covered by your Collision policy, such as theft, flood, storms, or collisions with animals.

**Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist.** Covers expenses resulting from when an uninsured or underinsured driver is at fault. About 30% of American drivers don’t have enough insurance, meaning there’s a 3 in 10 chance you’ll wish you had this type of coverage.

**Medical Payments.** Covers medical expenses if you or any other passengers in your vehicle are hurt in an accident.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Compulsory in some states, PIP covers a wider range of costs than Medical Payments, including medical and rehabilitation costs, income loss, funeral costs, and replacement services.

Some are compulsory in certain states, while other types of insurance are voluntary

In addition, it also offers you the chance to customize your policy with these add-ons.

**New Car Pledge.** If your car suffers a total loss in the first 2 model years (or 24,000 miles) of ownership, Farmers will replace it with a brand new model.

**Accident Forgiveness.** Insurers are known for increasing rates for policyholders who have frequent accidents, but Farmers will forgive one accident for every three years you drive without one.

**Incident Forgiveness.** Farmers won’t increase your rates for getting a speeding ticket ot running through a stop sign – as long as no one files a claim related to the incident.

**Loss of Use.** Promises reimbursement for transport costs if you lose use of your vehicle for a period of time.

**Personal Umbrella.** Provides an extra layer of coverage on your auto policy (and on your homeowners’ policy if you’ve bundled that together with your car insurance).

**Towing & Roadside Assistance.** Farmers also runs Farmers Claim Services, which can assist you with emergency jump-start, tire repair, locksmith services, and glass repair services in the event of a breakdown.

**Rental Reimbursement.** Provides a rental vehicle after an accident.

**Extended Customized Equipment Coverage.** Covers damaged or stolen equipment such as stereo system or rims.

**Farmers Rideshare.** For drivers who work for rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft.
