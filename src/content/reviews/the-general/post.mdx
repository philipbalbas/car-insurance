## In a Nutshell

The General is well known for its series of hilarious ads featuring Shaquille O’Neal and a cartoon military general, but did you know it’s been providing car insurance to American motorists for more than 50 years? The General is actually made up of a collection of companies including Permanent General Assurance Corporation that sell car insurance and other insurance products to residents of 47 states plus DC.

## Pros and Cons

Unlike most car insurance companies, The General allows anyone to request an online quote anonymously and without having to provide any contact details. Just enter your zip code, date of birth, and detailed information about your vehicle and General will show you exactly how much it will cost you to purchase car insurance. You can save the quote for later and use the figure to compare with other car insurance providers; or you can purchase insurance right away if you’re happy with The General’s offer.

The General has standard coverage for all motorists but specializes in providing insurance to drivers who might find it hard to get coverage from elsewhere. This includes drivers who have: never been insured, have had their previous coverage lapse; have been involved in accidents in the past; or are considered high-risk.

Residents of almost every state can purchase car insurance from The General. Unfortunately, almost isn’t quite the same as all, and The General doesn’t currently offer its products to motorists in Massachusetts, Michigan, or Hawaii.

## Types of Auto Insurance

The General sells the following types of car insurance coverage:

**Liability coverage.** Comprising Bodily Injury liability and Property Damage liability, this covers expenses when you injure another driver or damage someone else’s vehicle or property while in the act of driving.

**Medical Payments coverage.** This covers your or your family’s medical expenses when one of you is injured as a result of a traffic accident. It applies regardless of who is fault.

**Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist coverage.** This adds an extra layer of liability coverage to protect you when you’re in an accident caused by a driver who is uninsured or underinsured (i.e. the at-fault driver isn’t sufficiently covered for expenses).

**Comprehensive and Collision.** Collision coverage pays for the repair or replacement of your vehicle if you’re involved in an accident, regardless of who’s at fault. Comprehensive coverage pays for repairs or replacement if your vehicle is damaged for any other reason, such as floods, storms, fire, theft, vandalism, or hitting an animal.

The General can also help you:

- Obtain proper SR-22 documentation if your state demands legally acceptable proof of insurance.
- High-risk insurance, if you find yourself in any of the following categories: you’ve had your license suspended and require an SR-22 policy to have it reinstated; you have a history of car accidents, traffic violations or DUIs; or one of the policy holders is aged more than 70 or less than 20.

## How to Apply

It takes only 1-2 minutes to get an online quote and you don’t even have to hand over any identifying information or contact details. On The General website, simply enter your zip code under the heading “Get a quick quote”. Then follow these steps:

- Enter some basic details, such as date of birth, marital status, and the amount of time you and any other policy holders have been licensed. Answer yes or no as to whether you’ve had your license suspended in the past three years, been involved in any accidents or violations in the past three years or been convicted of a DUI in the past 10 years.
- On the next page, enter details about your vehicle, such as make, model, style, year, and the estimated annual mileage.
- That’s it! Within a couple of seconds, you’ll get a quote for The General’s recommended coverage with your states minimum requirements. The quote will include a detailed breakdown of your first 12 months of payments, including down payment, future, costs, and total premium. You can use the reference number at the top of the screen to return later and purchase coverage online or over the phone.

## Filing a Claim

There are two ways to file a claim or check an existing claim: by phone (1-800-280-1466) or through The General app. Both options are open 24/7. You can use the app to enter all necessary information, including photos and details of the incident. The "Damage Map" feature allows you to document exactly where damage was caused to the vehicle. The "Claim Tracker" feature lets you stay up to date with your claim. Whether you file by phone or mobile, a claims adjustor will be int ouch with you within a few days of your claim to get more information and talk you through the process. Your claims adjustor will be your point of contact for the duration of the process.

## Contact The General

To contact The General, use one of these channels:

**Phone:** 1-88-519-7422, during extended business hours. You can also email The General or request a call via the "Email Us" and "Call Me" buttons in The General’s online Help Center.

## Summary

The General specializes in providing affordable car insurance coverage to drivers who have trouble getting coverage elsewhere – such as drivers who have never been insured, have had their previous coverage lapse, or have been involved in accidents. Unlike other insurance companies, The General lets you request an online quote without handing over any personal details. You can see exactly how much you’d pay for a state-minimum insurance policy – without any obligations and without having to worry about getting dozens of calls or emails from agents wanting your business.
