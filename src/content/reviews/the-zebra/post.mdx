The Zebra is quite possibly the largest car insurance search engine in the United States, helping users search and compare more than 1,800 auto insurance policies from more than 200 insurers. The Zebra’s platform pulls in quotes from all its partners in real time, helping you find the best policy to fit your budget, location, and level of coverage. The service is completely free of charge, and it takes only 3-5 minutes to fill out the short online form and get the best auto insurance rates.

## Pros and Cons

The best thing about The Zebra is its size. There are many online marketplaces for auto insurance, but few come close to matching the Zebra’s network of more than 200 insurance providers. Size gives The Zebra a number of advantages over its competitors. It offers a wider variety of car insurance providers. It offers every policy imaginable, from standard policies like collision and comprehensive to the more obscure like classic and antique car coverage. And by bringing together many insurance firms under one roof, it causes those firms to compete on price – helping its customers get reduced premiums from top insurance providers like Allstate, Esurance, MetLife, 21st Century, Farmers, Nationwide, Progressive, and USAA.

There aren’t any noticeable downsides to this service, although it’s worth mentioning here that this is a marketplace and not a direct insurance provider. If, for whatever reason, you prefer to deal with auto insurance companies directly and not use any service that could potentially lower your rates, then the Zebra isn’t for you.

**Liability.** Consisting of Bodily Injury Liability and Property Damage Liability, this covers injuries to other motorists and/or damage to other people’s property if you’re at fault in an accident.

**Collision.** Covers the costs of repairing or replacing your vehicle if it is damaged in a collision with another vehicle or object.

**Comprehensive.** Covers damages to your vehicle from non-collision incidents, including fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.

**Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist.** Covers liabilities if the other driver is at fault but doesn’t have a sufficient level of insurance to cover the costs.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Covers costs related to injuries incurred by you or your passengers in an accident, including medical expenses, rehabilitation, and lost income.

**Medical payments coverage.** Covers basic medical care if you or your passengers are injured in a car accident, regardless of who was at fault.

**Emergency roadside Assistance.** Covers towing, tire change, jump-start, fuel delivery, lock-out service, and extraction if your car breaks down or gets stuck on the road.

**Gap coverage.** Covers the gap between what you owe on your car and what your car is worth in the event your car’s value depreciates as a result of an accident.

**Rideshare Coverage.** Covers you while you’re driving for Uber or other ride-hailing companies.

**Equipment coverage.** Protects you in the event of damage and loss of equipment you installed in your vehicle (as opposed to equipment installed by the manufacturer, which is covered by collision insurance).

The Zebra offers a number of other free tools and resources, including:

**Insurability Score.** This patent-pending tool calculates a personalized score between 400 and 950 for every driver, with higher scores representing a higher chance of being insured. Visitors to The Zebra website can get their score by filling out a short online form.

**Rate Analyzer.** A real-time guide to auto insurance pricing. Users can find out how their rates rise or fall by entering information on things like vehicle type, driving record, and their own personal info. This tool alone is worth a couple of minutes of your time, even if you don’t plan on using The Zebra’s quote tool to get auto coverage.

**Customize features.** Thanks to these customizable settings, users can filter insurance companies according to factors like online application vs. local agent.

## How to Apply

The beautiful thing about using a tool like The Zebra is that you can get the best quotes from all of its partners simply by filling out one form. The form takes only a few minutes to complete and requires you to enter the following details:

- Zip code
- Vehicle information, including year, make, model, whether you own or lease the car, what you use it for, and estimated annual mileage.
- Personal information, include name, address, marital status, estimated credit score, level of education, home ownership or rental details, and information about any tickets received in the previous 3 years.
- Details that might qualify you for a discount. These include: auto pay, new car, home ownership, full-time employment, military service, paperless delivery, good credit, and good driving history.
  Within a few seconds of completing the form, you’ll be shown a list of top results from different insurance providers. Click the “Get Quote” button next to your preferred policy to be redirected to that insurance provider’s website, where you’ll be asked to complete an additional short application form.
