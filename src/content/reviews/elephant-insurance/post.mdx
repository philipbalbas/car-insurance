## In a Nutshell

Elephant Insurance is a large insurance company offering a full suite of auto insurance policies as well as other insurance products such as property and life insurance. It was founded in Richmond, Virginia, in 2009, and serves customers in 6 states. It has quickly established a reputation for offering competitively priced car insurance backed by good customer service.

## Pros and Cons

Elephant allows policyholders to add extra coverage or make changes to their existing coverage at any time, with changes taking effect within 24 hours. Say you start off with just the minimum coverage required in your state, e.g. bodily injury liability and property damage liability. It’s quick and easy to add collision, comprehensive or any other type of coverage later on. Elephant also rewards customers for their loyalty by offering discounts of up to 40% on the price of car insurance for registering multiple vehicle or purchasing other types – such as homeowners’ insurance or renters’ insurance.

Elephant currently serves 6 states but is planning to branch out to more locations. These are the states where it is currently available for car insurance: Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia. Elephant is a good provider for standard policies, but it’s worth noting that it doesn’t offer much in the way of specialty policies. For example, it doesn’t offer custom policies for classic or antique cars.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Elephant offers these types of car insurance:

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers expenses related to other people’s injuries if you’re at fault in a car accident, such as medical bills, loss of income, or pain and suffering.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers expenses if your car damages someone else’s property, such as their car, house, or anything else that belongs to them.

**Collision.** Covers damages to your car when it collides with another vehicle or another object (such as a pole).

**Comprehensive.** Covers damages to your car for losses from incidents not covered by your Collision policy. This could include theft, flood, storms, or collision with animals.

**Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist.** Covers certain expenses resulting from accidents in which the other party was at fault but is either uninsured or doesn’t have a sufficient level of insurance to cover your expenses.

**Loan/Lease Payoff.** Also known as “Gap coverage”, this policy pays the remaining loan balance on a financed vehicle if that vehicle suffers a total loss. The Comprehensive or Collision coverage pays the actual cash value for the vehicle, minus the deductible; the Loan/Lease Payoff then pays the difference between the cash value and any remaining amount owed on the car.

**Medical Payments.** Covers medical expenses for injuries to you or your passengers resulting from an auto accident, regardless of which driver was a fault.

**Rental Reimbursement.** Covers the cost of a rental car if your car is in the shop for more than 24 hours.

**Roadside Assistance.** Provides roadside services through a third-party company, including: towing, jump-start, tire replacement, fuel delivery, and lock-out services.

**Custom Parts and Equipment Coverage.** Covers permanently attached equipment, devices, and accessories added by anyone other than the car maker.

**Income Loss Coverage.** Covers any income loss resulting from injuries caused by an accident.
