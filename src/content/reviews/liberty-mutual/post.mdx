## In a Nutshell

Liberty Mutual is the third-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States, underwriting more than \$21 billion in annual premiums for car insurance and other types of insurance. It serves customers in all 50 states and DC with liability and medical payments coverage plus optional add-ons. Its strong ratings from credit agencies A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P testify to its financial strength and ability to pay out on insurance claims.

## Pros and Cons

One of the major benefits of using Liberty Mutual for your car insurance is the flexibility it provides. With Liberty Mutual Deductible Fund, you can lower your potential liabilities by voluntarily contributing towards your deductible. And when you contribute to your fund, Liberty Mutual does too. The following image shows just how much you can save.

Liberty Mutual offers a number of ways to save on your premiums. It offers discounts simply for adding or changing a vehicle on your policy or for bundling together your auto insurance with other insurance products from its catalog – such as homeowners’ insurance or motorcycle insurance. You can also earn up to a 30% reduction for good driving behavior.

One con to be aware of is that not all programs are available in all states. For example, driver rewards aren’t available in a handful of states. Due to differing state regulations, the terms and conditions of its programs can differ slightly from state to state.
