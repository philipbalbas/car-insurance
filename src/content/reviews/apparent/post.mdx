## In a Nutshell

Apparent Insurance is an online auto insurer that caters to parents with teenage drivers and/or other children. It has optional family-friendly add-ons like car-seat replacement and a teen driver mobile app. In addition to car insurance, Apparent offers bundles with home, renters, motorcycle, umbrella, and life insurance. Apparent Insurance is owned by UK-based Admiral Group and underwritten by Redpoint County Mutual Insurance Company, Virginia.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:** There are many benefits to using Apparent Insurance for your vehicle insurance needs, but the biggest is undoubtedly family focus. Most car insurance companies offer stock-standard vehicle coverage with barely a though to the unique and diverse needs of policy holders and their families. However, Apparent is not your ordinary insurance provider. It offers extended coverage and add-ons to suit families with children of all ages – from newborns to teen drivers.

**Cons:** It’s hard to find anything to complain about, although if we have to name one downside it would be a lack of licensing information. We searched the Apparent Insurance website for information about state licenses and couldn’t find anything. Apparent is a nationwide insurer but, as with other insurers, there’s a possibility that coverage doesn’t extend to 100% of the United States.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Apparent Insurance has vehicle coverage to suit the needs of drivers in 50 states.

**Liability.** Covering bodily injury liability and property damage liability, which are obligatory in most states.

**Collision.** Covering expenses when your vehicle is damaged in a collision with another vehicle or object.

**Comprehensive.** Covering expenses when your vehicle is damaged in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, or theft.

**Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist.** Covering all your liabilities just in case you get into an incident with an uninsured or underinsured driver.

**Medical Payments (or Personal Injury Protection).** Covering medical bills, rehabilitation, and other costs incurred when you or anyone else in your car is injured in an accident.

## Additional Features

When it comes to extended coverage and add-ons, Apparent Insurance really stands out with a range of products to suit all types of families.

**Teen driver app.** The free Bouncie app helps teen drivers stay safe with customized alerts and speed and safety tracking.

**Smart roadside assistance.** Offered by partner Urgent.ly, this is 24/7 roadside assistance re-designed to give parents peace of mind. It includes real-time tracking of the service provider’s progress toward your (or your child’s) vehicle and a service-tracking link so your teen driver can keep you in the loop.

**At-home mechanic.** Instead of dragging the kids to the mechanic, this service sends a mechanic to your home.

**Rental car match.** If you drive a large, family car, this service ensures you get a replacement car of a similar size when your own car is in the shop.

**Custom equipment coverage.** For parents who install extra parts in their vehicle, like a cool stereo system for your kids or teenage driver.

**Accident forgiveness.** Protects you from having your premium go up after an accident.

**Car seat and stroller replacement.** Guaranteed reimbursement coverage for car seats and strollers in the event they are damaged or destroyed in a covered accident.

**Upgraded accident forgiveness.** Perfect for teen drivers, this provides an extra layer of coverage for your family.

## How to Apply

There are two ways to purchase insurance from Apparent: online or over the phone. The online option is the quickest and typically takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. To begin, go to the Apparent Insurance website and click the “Get Quote” bubble at the top of the home page.

From the moment you begin filling out the car insurance application form, the family-friendly nature of this service becomes apparent. On the first page, you’ll be asked to state who is applying, with the options being: just me today; me + partner; me + kids; me + partner + kids. If you have kids, the next step is to select their age groups from the following options: little ones (expecting to 7 years old), tweens (8-13); teens (14-18), and young adults (19-24).

The rest of the application form is more or less the same as you’ll find with other insurance companies. It includes sections about the vehicle(s) and driver(s). At the end, you’ll be given the option of signing up for various discounts, including bundling (with home, renters, life, motorcycle, or umbrella), good student discount, e-signature, online, and paperless discounts.

## Filing a Claim

To file a claim, just go to the Apparent Insurance website’s Claims page, select from “glass-only claim” or “all other claims”, and fill out details of your claim. The claims process is super simple with no need to sign in to an account or upload any details of your policy. All it requires is your name and contact details, followed by details and supporting documentation in relation to the incident. Once you’re done, an Apparent claims agent will be in touch with you shortly after. All coverage is underwritten by Redpoint County Mutual Insurance Company in Virginia.

## Contact Details

The Apparent Insurance website offers a smooth, streamlined application and claims process. Apparent offers a toll-free phone service during extended business hour for all additional queries and quotes.
