## In a Nutshell

Dairyland has been providing auto and motorcycle insurance to American motorists since the 1950s. Founded in Wisconsin, it started out selling specialty insurance to drivers who couldn’t get standard coverage because of poor driving records or no prior insurance. Today, it is owned by Sentry Insurance and serves motorists in 37 states with a wide range of flexible plans at affordable rates, including pay-as-you-go auto insurance.

## Pros and Cons

Dairyland’s main selling point is its competitive pricing. It offers seven easy ways to earn discounts, including getting a quote at least a week before you need insurance, adding multiple vehicles to your policy, and agreeing to install anti-theft mechanisms in your vehicle. It also offers pay-as-you-go car insurance, where your rates are calculated according to how many miles you drive. Dairyland is one of a handful of nationwide car insurance providers offering this type of insurance, which effectively rewards people who drive less than the average motorist.

Aside from being unavailable in 13 states, the other disadvantage to Dairyland is it offers fewer add-ons than some of its rival insurers. If you’re looking to purchase the minimum level of auto insurance required by your state at a competitive price, then Dairyland could be the right choice for you. But if you’re looking for stacks of add-ons like ride-sharing coverage or protection for when your pet travels with you in your vehicle, Dairyland doesn’t offer these.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Dairyland offers all the standard types of auto insurance, ensuring you meet the minimum insurance obligations required by your state.

**Liability.** Consisting of Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability, this covers you when other motorists are injured or someone else’s property is damaged in an accident where you’re at fault.

**Collision.** Pays for repair or replacement of your car if it’s damaged in a collision with another vehicle or object.

**Comprehensive.** Pays for repair or replacement in non-collision incidents, including fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.

**Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist.** Protects you from having to fork out money for someone else’s liabilities if the other driver is at fault but doesn’t have a sufficient level of car insurance.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Pays for expenses like hospital treatment, medical care, rehabilitation, and lost income if you or your passengers are hurt in an accident.

**Medical Payments.** In some states, this pays for medical expenses for you and your passengers, regardless of who’s at fault.

## Additional Features

**Towing and Labor.** If you get stuck out on the road, this coverage ensures someone will pick up your vehicle and take it to a service center for repairs.

**Rental Reimbursement.** When you car is in the shop, this type of coverage gives you money towards a rental so you 0can keep going about your daily business.

**Lienholder.** Some people like giving their car some extra touches, but what happens if you get in an accident? This unique type of coverage helps pay to re-apply your custom touches. Certain restrictions may apply to this coverage.

**Special Equipment.** Pays for damages to special equipment you installed in your vehicle, i.e. to equipment that wasn’t installed by the manufacturer.

**Non-owner Car Insurance.** For those who primarily use public transportation but occasionally drive as well.

**SR-22.** Providing SR-22 filing at affordable rates in states where this is a requirement for drivers with a DUI on their record.

**Driver Discounts.** As mentioned in the Pros and Cons, Dairyland offers the following driver discounts: insuring multiple vehicles, getting a quote at least a week in advance; paying more than the minimum down; transferring from 0another insurer; taking a defensive driver course; being a homeowner; and installing an anti-theft device.

## How to Apply

New customers can apply for auto insurance by contracting Dairyland directly or by speaking to an independent agent in their area who sells Dairyland insurance. Depending on where you live, it may be cheaper to buy car insurance directly from Dairyland, thereby avoiding the additional fees associated with agents. To purchase from Dairyland, simply call customer service or get a quote online. You’ll be asked to enter: personal details, including name, address, and contact details; information about your driving history and any other family members being added to the policy; information about your vehicle or vehicles; and any info that qualifies you for driver discounts. Dairyland lets you upload documents online, so you can walk away with your car insurance the same day as applying.

## Filing a Claim

Although Dairyland has an app to help customers with billing, its app doesn’t yet extend to claims. At present, the only way to make an auto claim is by calling the Dairyland claims team toll-free at 800-334-0090. When you make a claim, a Dairyland claims representative will be assigned to help get you a quick estimate for repairs, as well as a rental car if you have the appropriate level of coverage.

## Contact Details

Dairyland has a new mobile app for iOS and Android where customers can manage their policies, make payments, get billing notifications, and access all their policy documentation. To get a quote or make an enquiry, Dairyland can be reached at the following:

## Summary

Dairyland Insurance provides cheap car insurance to motorists in 37 states, with a wide range of opportunities to earn driver discounts. Importantly, it is one of a handful of national car insurers offering pay-as-you-go insurance, which rewards motorists who drive less than the average by charging them on a per-mile basis. It’s also a good choice for drivers who have a DUI on their record, given its experience with the SR-22 process and with motorists who don’t qualify for standard auto coverage
