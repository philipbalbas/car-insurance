## In a Nutshell

EverQuote is a leading insurance marketplace that connects drivers with the best quotes from leading auto insurance carriers. Its sophisticated search tool returns multiple personalized insurance quotes in minutes. It matches users with the insurers that best fits their needs and budget–bringing in a licensed agent to complete the process. EverQuote’s partners include big names like Progressive, Nationwide, State Farm, and Farmers Insurance.

## Pros and Cons

Pro: It may sound strange, but it’s the small details that make EverQuote stand out. The subtle touches are there from the moment you enter the EverQuote homepage and see the streamlined quote-request form at the top of the screen. To request a quote, the user must first enter their zip code, state how EverQuote can help (Currently insured, need savings; Currently insured, just curious; Uninsured, need coverage; Uninsured, just curious); and state how many vehicles they wish to insure (1, 2, or 3+). By asking users these 3 simple questions, EverQuote is able to streamline its application form and avoid asking time-consuming or irrelevant questions later on.

Con: There aren’t any major downsides to this service. As with any online insurance marketplace, it’s worth pointing out this is not a direct insurance provider but rather a service that helps users compare and purchase policies from a range of insurers.

## Types of Auto Insurance

EverQuote works with a range of trusted and vetted insurers from around the United States. Each of its insurers offers the same standard types of policies but with varying limits and rates.

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers all expenses related to bodily injuries suffered by other drivers when you are at fault.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers all expenses related to damage of another person’s property when you are at fault.

**Collision.** Covers expenses related to vehicle repair and replacement if your vehicle is damaged in a collision, regardless of who was at fault.

**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement if your vehicle suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.

**Medical Payments / Personal Injury Protection.** Covers medical and rehabilitation expenses, and in some cases lost wages for you and any passengers, no matter who was at fault.

**Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist.** Covers the other driver’s liabilities if they are uninsured or underinsured.

## Additional Feature

EverQuote is unique among marketplaces in that it offers its own safe driving app: EverDrive. The EverDrive app is free to download and available on the App Store or Google Play. It is currently available in Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia, with more states to come. This app automatically records your driving and passively monitors your habits. It gives you a score along with tips to adjust your driving.

The purpose of the app is to help drivers improve their habits and thereby qualify for up to 30% in additional insurance savings.Because EverQuote works with such a wide range of insurers, it also provides a gateway to a wide range of possible features and add-ons. Below are some of the additional features offered by EverQuote’s trusted insurance partners. Gap coverage. If your car is totaled or stolen, this covers the gap between the depreciated value and what you still owe. Rental reimbursement. If your vehicle is in the shop due to a covered accident, this covers the cost of renting a temporary replacement. Roadside assistance. If you’re stuck out on the interstate or the back roads, this ensures swift emergency assistance. Rideshare coverage. For people who use their vehicle for work with ridesharing platforms like Uber, this provides suitable coverage. Discounts and rewards. Most of EverQuote’s partners offer multiple discount opportunities, including but not limited to: homeowners, safe driving program, installation of safety devices in vehicle, bundling with other types of insurance.

## How to Apply

As mentioned, the application form is one of the highlights of the EverQuote service. While some other marketplaces have clunky forms that take time to fill out, EverQuote asks the important questions first – and then uses your answers to show you questions that are relevant to your application. Before requesting a quote, it’s worth preparing the following information in advance: Personal info: Information about yourself and other drivers on the policy, including names, contact details, and dates of birth. Vehicle info: Details about the vehicles being insured, including, make, model, year, and mileage.

Driving history: Details about your driving history, including how long you’ve been licensed, where the license was issued, and whether you’ve had any claims or accidents in the past 3 years.

Discounts page: EverQuote will ask for some additional information in order to find out if it can help you qualify for insurance carrier discounts.

## Filing a Claim

Like other insurance marketplaces, EverQuote exists to match customers with insurance carriers and agents. It doesn’t have anything to do with the claims process. Once you purchase a policy from an agent and carrier, speak to them to find out how to make claims. As a general rule, most of EverQuote’s insurance partners offer multiple, convenient ways of filing claims, including: phone, online, and mobile app.

## Contact Details

While primarily an online platform, EverQuote does offer customer support during business hours. To get a quote or ask questions, call 855-522-3444.

## Summary

There are many online insurance marketplaces out there, and it’s safe to say EverQuote is among the slickest and most user-friendly on the market. The EverQuote platform is easy on the eye and it’s easy to use. Along every step of the way, EverQuote takes care to simplify and streamline the application process. The end result is that it takes less than 2 minutes to enter your details and get multiple quotes from top insurers.
