## In a Nutshell

Nexgen Insurance Group is an independent insurance agency located in Canfield, Ohio. Founded in 2017, it offers a range of personal and commercial insurance products, including personal auto insurance. According to Nexgen, its core principles are integrity, professionalism, and providing a high quality of service that exceeds customer expectations.

## Pros and Cons

**Pro:** The best reason to use an independent insurance agency like Nexgen is that they do all the work for you. Instead of running around trying to get quotes from different insurance agents, Nexgen taps into its network of partners to find the best deal for you. As a full-service independent agency, Nexgen takes care of the entire auto insurance process, from collecting your details to getting you approved and bringing you the final closing documents to be signed.

**Con:** Nexgen’s website explains a little about what the agency does, but there is a glaring lack of information about how the agency operates, what types of coverage it can broker, and which areas of the United States it serves.

## Types of Auto Insurance

From what we could gather, Nexgen is licensed to broker deals for a number of large insurance carriers such as Liberty Mutual. Its partners offer all the standard forms of car insurance used by drivers around the U.S.

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers all expenses related to bodily injuries suffered by other drivers when you are at fault.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers all expenses related to damage of another person’s property when you are at fault.

**Collision.** Covers expenses related to vehicle repair and replacement if your vehicle is damaged in a collision, regardless of who was at fault.

**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement if your vehicle suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Covers medical and rehabilitation expenses, and in some cases lost wages for you and any other passengers, no matter who was at fault.

**Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist.** Covers the other driver’s liabilities if they are uninsured or underinsured. This type of coverage is voluntary.

## Additional Features

Nexgen’s website doesn’t offer a great deal of information about what the agency does. Given it works with large insurance providers, Nexgen should theoretically be able to offer paid add-ons like rental reimbursement, gap coverage, and rideshare coverage. However, we can’t say for certain that this is the case. Nexgen works across auto insurance, home insurance, and other lines of insurance, and can arrange bundling discounts (which typically reach up to 5-10%). Judging from the small number of customer reviews we could find, Nexgen has a high approval rating – mainly as a result of its strong customer service.

## How to Apply

As a small agency, Nexgen offers two methods of applying: online or phone. To get started, call Nexgen directly or request a quote using the online application form. Either way, it only takes a few minutes to answer the application form, which consists of question about you and your fellow policyholders, you and your co-drivers’ driving history, and the vehicle(s) you wish to insure.

As mentioned, Nexgen has a good reputation for customer service. Although we could only find a few testimonials for Nexgen, these reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Multiple customers have testified that Nexgen’s agents helped them save money on auto (and home) insurance, including one happy user who wrote a comment on Nexgen’s Facebook page saying they saved \$300.

## Filing a Claim

Most small agencies stay with the customer throughout the duration of their policy, helping with any claims should the need arise. Nexgen doesn’t offer any information about the claims process on its website. We suggest speaking to your Nexgen agent about the claims process before signing any final insurance documents.

## Summary

Independent insurance agencies grow on strong customer service, and it appears Nexgen makes its customers happy. While Nexgen’s website could offer more information, from what we can gather it provides a solid service. Certainly, the fact that all the customer reviews appear to be positive, and that customers claim to save money with Nexgen, is reason enough to recommend speaking to Nexgen about your auto coverage.
