## In a Nutshell

US Insurance Agents offers an online marketplace and educational resource for different lines of insurance, including car insurance. Although it has the word “agents” in its name, it is not actually an insurance agency. In actual fact, it is a marketplace that lets you compare the best rates from a range of top auto insurance carriers.

## Pros and Cons

**Pro:** The main reason to use US Insurance Agents is to compare rates from different insurance carriers. If you’re just starting out the search for vehicle coverage, US Insurance Agents can save you time and effort by concentrating all your options in the one place. Simply fill out the short application form on the US Insurance Agents website to pull in quotes from top insurance companies.

**Con:** The name US Insurance Agents is a bit misleading, because US Insurance Agents isn’t actually an agency. An insurance agency is a company that brokers an insurance policy on your behalf, as in they do all the legwork for you. With US Insurance Agents, this isn’t exactly the case. This service helps you compare and connect with insurance carriers, but it is left up to you to complete the process.

## Types of Auto Insurance

US Insurance Agents is your gateway to all types of insurance, including bodily injury liability, property damage liability, collision, comprehensive, personal injury protection (referred to as medical payments in some states), and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. US Insurance Agents works with a range of insurance carriers, forcing the carriers to compete for your attention by offering lower prices. Its partners include: Allstate, American Family, GEICO, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, Progressive, State Farm, Travelers, USAA, and Zurich North America.

## Additional Features

In addition to operating an insurance marketplace, US Insurance Agents offers a few useful tools and resources to help you in your search for suitable vehicle coverage.

**Agent search tool.** Allows you to search for listed agents in your area.

**Insurer search tool.** Allows you to search for car insurance providers in your area.

**Insurance reviews.** In-depth reviews of top insurance carriers.

**Insurance answers.** Answers to questions about car insurance such as “If your child does not drive any of our cars does she have to be on our policy if she lives with us?” and “Should I file a claim for hitting a road obstruction?”

**Databank.** Offers useful statistics to help you with your next vehicle purchase, such as lists of the most stolen vehicles in different states.

## How to Apply

It costs nothing to request a quote from US Insurance Agents. When you fill out a form, what you get is a list of suitable policies from US Insurance Agents partners. The application form itself is very similar to what you’ll find at other online marketplaces. Simply enter basic personal information, driver information (for you and all the other people on your policy), vehicle information (for all the vehicles you would like to insure) and driving history (again, for everyone on your policy). You will also be asked to disclose any accidents, claims, or DUIs in the last 3 years. You may also get the opportunity to apply for certain discounts, such as military service and good driving behavior. The entire process takes only 2-3 minutes. At the end, you will be given the chance to select your preferred insurance carriers and complete a formal application.

## Filing a Claim

US Insurance Agents isn’t a formal agency and doesn’t handle claims. To file a claim, you will need to communicate directly with your chosen insurance carrier. Most of the top insurance carriers US Insurance Agents works with offer multiple ways of filing a claim, including: phone, fax, email, online, and in some cases a mobile app.

## Contact Details

Unfortunately, US Insurance Agents doesn’t offer much in the way of customer service. There are only two ways of getting in touch, and neither are terribly efficient. Option one is by sending a message through the contact form on the Contact Us page on the US Insurance Agents website. Option two is by sending mail to the following address:

US Insurance Agents

2885 Sanford Ave SW # 13189

Grandville, MI 49418

## Summary

If you’re just starting out your search for insurance, then US Insurance Agents is one place you can begin your search. That’s because it offers educational resources and helps you compare policies from top insurance carriers. US Insurance Agents won’t actually broker insurance on your behalf, but it can help you compare your options – which is an effective way of getting the best deal.
