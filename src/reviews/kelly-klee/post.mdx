## In a Nutshell

Kelly Klee is a private insurance agency that specializes in brokering coverage for specialty vehicles and high-value homes. If you own a recreational vehicle, all-terrain vehicle, golf cart, or any other type of specialty vehicle, Kelly Klee can get you suitable coverage. Kelly Klee works directly with 7 major insurance companies that specialize in serving high-net worth individuals and in covering expensive vehicles.

## Pros and Cons

**Pro:** A standard vehicle needs standard insurance from a standard insurance company. A specialty vehicle needs specialty insurance from a specialty insurance company. Kelly Klee works with 7 of the top insurance companies in the United States that specialize in specialty vehicle coverage. According to Kelly Klee, its partner insurance carriers work with only about 5% of brokers who apply. This means Kelly Klee is one of the only agencies you can go to for personalized specialty vehicle coverage brokering.

**Con:** In addition to brokering specialty vehicle coverage, Kelly Klee also offers regular auto insurance. If you have specialty vehicle(s) and regular vehicle(s) you’d like insured, then technically Kelly Klee can help. However, we’re not convinced they can offer the best rates on regular insurance. Therefore, if you’re looking the best deal, you may want to split your coverage and use another agency for your regular vehicles.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Together with its partnering insurance carriers, Kelly Klee offers liability, collision, comprehensive, personal injury protection, and uninsured motorist coverage for all types of specialty vehicles. According to Kelly Klee, the specialty vehicle category is a catchall for a variety of motorized land-transportation products. Whether they are driven on public roadways or off-road, specialty vehicles need to be insured, both for liability reasons and because they tend to be more valuable than most regular vehicles.

The following are considered specialty vehicles:

- Recreational vehicles (e.g. motorhomes, campervans, caravans, fifth-wheel trailers, popup campers, and truck campers).

- Motorcycles (e.g. standard, cruiser, sport, touring, dual-purpose, dirt bike)

- All-Terrain Vehicles

- Golf carts

- Snowmobiles

## Additional Features

Specialty vehicles need specialty solutions. Kelly Klee’s agents are well-trained in the different types of coverage your vehicle might need.

In addition to the standard types of coverage, Kelly Klee also offers:

- Agreed Value Option: Pays out a set non-depreciable amount for your vehicle that you approve at the start of the policy.

- Cash Settlement Option: Gives you the option of accepting a cash settlement instead of repair in certain circumstances, if you so choose.

- Original Replacement Parts: Covers the cost of replacing original equipment manufacturer’s parts if needed as a result of a covered incident.

- Non-Deductible Collision: Provides collision coverage without a deductible if an uninsured driver causes damage to your vehicle.

## How to Apply

In life, you get what you pay for, and with Kelly Klee you get a highly professional service from your own personal expert agent. Judging by customer testimonials, it should take no more than one hour for an agent to call you back and broker a suitable insurance policy on your behalf.
