## In a Nutshell

Progressive opened its first drive-in claims office in 1937 and has kept growing over the past 80 years to become one of America’s largest auto insurance companies. Today it sells car insurance online and over the phone to motorists in all 50 states and DC. Progressive’s policies and add-ons are competitively priced, and it also offers ways to reduce your premium and deductibles.

## Pros and Cons

The most obvious benefit to using Progressive for your car insurance is that it’s a big lender with a strong credit rating and reputation – meaning you’ll never need to lose sleep worrying about its ability to pay out on insurance claims. Because Progressive offers multiple lines of insurance, you can bundle your auto insurance with property insurance or other types of insurance to receive an overall discount.

Another pro is its unique “Name Your Price” tool, where you tell Progressive how much you want to pay and it shows you what types of coverage can fit in your budget. You can also use Progressive’s comparison tool to compare your Progressive coverage with the exact same coverages from several other auto insurance providers.

As with any insurance policy, you should be aware of a few things in the fine print. For example, Progressive’s gap insurance only covers up to 25% above the value of your car if it suffers a total loss – anything above 25% is yours to cover.

## Types of Auto Insurance

**Progressive offers the following types of car insurance coverage:**

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Pays another person’s medical expenses and lost income and covers legal fees if you’re at fault in an accident.
**Property Damage Liability.** Pays for damage you cause to someone else’s vehicle and property, such as a house or fence.
**Collision.** Pays to repair or replace your damaged vehicle if you collide with another vehicle or object. Also includes pet injury protection, which pays certain amounts for medical care if your dog or cat is injured in a car accident.
**Comprehensive.** Pays to repair or replace your damaged vehicle if it suffers damage from anything other than a collision, such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.
**Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist.** Covers Bodily Injury and Property Damage liabilities if the at-fault driver doesn’t have any insurance or if their level of insurance isn’t high enough to cover the costs for which they’re liable.
**Medical Payments.** Pays for medical and funeral expenses if you or any passengers are injured or die in an accident. Also applies if you or other family members named on the policy are passengers in other vehicles or are hit by a car while out walking. In some states, Progressive offers a higher level of Personal Injury Protection (PIP) for medical expenses.

**Policy holders can add the following coverage and benefits to their auto insurance policy:**

**Roadside Assistance.** Pays for towing, tire change, fuel delivery, or lock-out service if your car breaks down or you get stuck far from home.
**Loan / Lease Payoff.** Also known as gap coverage, this covers the difference between what you owe on the vehicle and what it’s worth after an accident – but it’s limited to 25% above the value of the car.
**Rental Car Reimbursement.** Pays for a rental car if your vehicle is in the shop following an accident.
Custom Parts and Equipment Value. Repairs or replaces any items you added to your car, such as a stereo system, GPS system, or custom wheels.
**Rideshare Coverage.** Extends your car insurance to cover you while you’re driving for Uber, Lyft, or any other rideshare company.
Deductible Savings Bank. With this feature, you get rewards for driving accident free. For every six months you drive without filing a claim, $50 gets subtracted from your deductible. For example, if you select a $500 deductible on your car insurance, it’ll drop to $450 if you go claim-free for six months, then to $400 after an additional claim-free period of six months, and so on until your deductible reaches \$0.

**You can earn discounts with the following programs:**

- With a multi-policy discount, your premium gets reduced by 5% just for combining your auto insurance with another type of insurance such as motorcycle or homeowners’ insurance.

- With the Snapshot program, you can earn around \$130 off your premium by agreeing to have your driving behavior monitored.

- With the Safe Driver discount, you can earn up to one-third off your premium just for not getting into any accidents or traffic violations for a three-year period.

You can save 7-10% for any of the following: putting multiple vehicles on one policy, being a homeowner, getting your quote online, going paperless, e-signing all your documents online, paying for a six-month policy up front, and going on automatic payments.

## How to Apply

Progressive offers two ways to get a quote and purchase car insurance: by calling toll-free number 1-855-347-3939 or by applying online. Purchasing car insurance online requires you to fill in the following information:

- Basic personal details, such as name, date of birth, and postal address.

- Vehicle information, such as make, model, and year, plus annual mileage and the purpose for owning the vehicle (e.g. commute, pleasure, or both).

- Additional information about yourself and any other drivers you wish to add to the policy.

- A few final pieces of information, including the name of your current insurer if you have an existing auto insurance policy.

- Your quote will appear within a few seconds of completing the form. You’ll have the chance to review your rates, to add or remove voluntary add-ons, and to toggle your deductible. You can also save your quote and compare it to other insurers before purchasing.

## Filing a Claim

Filing a claim is fairly straightforward and can be done either by phone, through your online account, or with the Progressive app. You can even use the app to take a picture of your damaged car and get an immediate estimate. You can track your claim status at any time via online or mobile and get your car serviced at any one of Progressive’s network of approved shops around the country.
