## In a Nutshell

The Insurance Center is a veteran auto insurer serving the 9 million residents of Wisconsin and Iowa. It offers car insurance at discount rates when combined with home, life, health, or farm insurance. Initially founded in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1966 with the aim of serving dairy farm communities in southwestern Wisconsin, it now specializes in many different types of insurance, including vehicle coverage.

## Pros and Cons

If you’re a Wisconsin or Iowa resident, the main benefit to getting vehicle coverage from The Insurance Center is that it is provided by locals for locals. The Insurance Center, or TIC for short, has been doing business in both states for more than 50 years. It knows the Wisconsin and Iowa minimum insurance requirements inside out, it knows what drivers are looking for, and it knows how to provide the right level of coverage.

If you’re not from Wisconsin or Iowa, then The Insurance Center can’t serve you and has no plans to do so in the future. This is very much a local insurance business. If you’re from Illinois, Missouri, or even farther afield, then it’s best to look elsewhere for your car insurance.

## Types of Auto Insurance

The Insurance Center offers all standard forms of coverage required in Wisconsin and Iowa, as well as recommended extras.

**Liability.** Wisconsin motorists are legally required to have bodily injury liability up to a $25,000 limit per person or $50,000 limit per accident and property damage liability up to a $10,000 limit. Iowa motorists must have bodily injury liability up to a $20,000 per person limit or $40,000 per accident limit and property damage liability up to a $10,000 limit. Both Wisconsin and Iowa are “fault” insurance states, meaning the driver that causes the accident is liable for damages. The Insurance Center provides liability insurance to satisfy state requirements.

**Collision.** This covers vehicle repair if your vehicle suffers damage in a collision with another vehicle or object. Neither Wisconsin or Iowa require drivers to purchase this type of coverage. Nonetheless, this type of coverage is recommended.

**Comprehensive.** This covers vehicle repair if your ride suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as a fire, flood, vandalism, or theft. Neither Wisconsin or Iowa require drivers to purchase this type of coverage. Nonetheless, it is recommended.

**Uninsured / Underinsured Motorist.** Wisconsin requires drivers to purchase uninsured / underinsured motorist up to a $25,000 limit per person or $50,000 limit per accident. Iowa doesn’t require drivers to purchase this form of coverage, but you may still want to consider it.

**Medical Payments.** Covers things like medical costs, rehabilitation, and lost wages when you or your passengers are injured in an accident, whether or not you’re at fault.

## Additional Features

Unfortunately, The Insurance Center doesn’t provide much information about add-ons and features. With that said, motorists can expect to find the following features and deals.

**Roadside assistance.** For when you’re stuck out on the road and need immediate services like locksmith, tire repair, and glass replacement.

**Gap coverage.** Covers the gap between what you owe on your leased or financed car and what it’s worth after an accident.

**Bundling.** In addition to car insurance, The Insurance Center offers home insurance, life insurance, private health insurance, farm insurance, and agriculture insurance. Ask your agent how much you can save by bundling together car insurance with one or more other types of coverage.

## How to Apply

There are two ways to begin a The Insurance Center car insurance application. The first and easiest is by entering your name, zip code, phone number, and email address under the “Request a Quote” section on The Insurance Center’s home page. The second is by using the agent search tool on The Insurance Center website and contacting your local agent directly.

Either way, the process will continue with a telephone call with an insurance agent. You’ll be asked to supply the agent with certain information, including personal details, information about your vehicle and driving record, and information about things that might qualify you for discounts (such as military service or agreeing to autopay your premium).

## Filing a Claim

The Insurance Center offers claims support by phone and on the internet. Once you become a customer, The Insurance Center will provide you with login details. To access your documents or file a claim, simply go to the company website and click “Client Login” at the top of your screen. The Claims service is available 24/7, so you’re covered no matter what time of day you and your vehicle get into trouble.

## Contact Details

One of the great things about getting car insurance from a local provider is the local, personalized service. The Insurance Center provides customer service by phone or in branch during business hours. It also has a search tool on its website that allows new customers to find an agent in their local area.

## Summary

The Insurance Center stands for locals, with personalized car insurance for drivers throughout Wisconsin and Iowa. Going local has its pros and cons. This auto insurance provider doesn’t have all the frills and features of its larger, nationwide, insurance rivals. However, it does offer the sort of personal care and attention to detail that you can only get from an insurer in your neighborhood. With The Insurance Center, you purchase insurance from an agent that lives in your area and knows the needs of locals.
