## In a Nutshell

Advertising Disclosure Best Auto Insurance is an online car insurance marketplace that helps users compare and purchase auto coverage from some of the nation’s largest insurers. Like some of its rival auto insurance marketplaces, Best Auto Insurance’s platform scans through all of its partners to find the most suitable policy for each applicant according to their state, type of car, and budget.

## Pros and Cons

If you can look past the outdated website design, Best Auto Insurance actually provides a very useful service. Its search tool taps into 55 of the nation’s top car insurance providers to deliver the best rates and policies for each individual applicants’ needs. But the best thing here is its transparency. While most car insurance marketplaces require you to enter your contact details in order to get a quote, Best Auto Insurance advertises exactly which brands it works with – and offers a useful table comparing each of the brands according to measures like user satisfaction, pricing, and customer service. Visitors to the Best Auto Insurance website can search for the best insurance company by make, best insurance company by state, and best insurance company by policy. The service is free of charge, and visitors can use it to get as many quotes as they like without having to make any commitments whatsoever.

The only glaring disadvantage with this service is the lack of contact options. There’s no way to reach Best Auto by phone, and although there is an email address – Best Auto doesn’t make any promises regarding response times. The other thing worth mentioning here is that Best Auto Insurance is a marketplace and not a direct insurance provider. It’s a useful tool for finding the right auto coverage, but that is where it’s services end.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Best Auto Insurance works with dozens of the country’s top insurance providers to help drivers get the best deals on the following types of auto coverage:

**Liability.** Covers injury to other people and damage to other people’s property when you’re at fault in an accident. Pays for things like medical expenses, car repairs, and court costs. This type of coverage is mandatory in most states.
**Collision.** Covers repairs and replacement of your own vehicle in an accident with another vehicle or object.
**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement resulting from non-collision incidents such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.
**Uninsured Motorist / Underinsured Motorist.** Covers liability costs when you get into an accident with a driver who doesn’t have sufficient coverage.
**Personal injury protection.** Covers things like medical, rehabilitation, lost wages, and childcare when you and/or your passengers are injured as a result of an accident.
**Medical payments coverage.** Covers medical expenses if you and/or your passengers are injured as a result of an accident.
