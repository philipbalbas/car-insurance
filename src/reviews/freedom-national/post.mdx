## In a Nutshell

Freedom National Insurance Services is an auto insurance carrier serving drivers in Georgia, Arizona, and Utah. It also operates in California under the name Freedom General Insurance Services. Freedom National tailors its programs to drivers in the states where it operates, throwing in extra features like extended coverage option, good driver discount, and 24/7 claims processing. Overall, Freedom National claims to stand for cheap car insurance.

## Pros and Cons

Pro: Freedom National’s biggest selling point is local knowledge. It has been serving customers in Georgia, Arizona, and Utah for more than 20 years, and has built up a great deal of knowledge on the ins and out of vehicle coverage in each state. Freedom National’s agents are welluipped to advise customers on state minimum requirements. They also promise to go beyond just standard policies, offering to tailor policies according to the customer’s needs.
Con: The biggest pro is also the biggest con: Freedom National doesn’t offer its services to customers in states other than Georgia, Arizona, or Utah (or California, if you include sister company Freedom General). If you live in a state outside of Freedom National’s covered areas, then you will need to look elsewhere for vehicle coverage.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Each Freedom National auto policy begins with the standard types of coverage such as liability, comprehensive and collision.
**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers all expenses related to bodily injuries suffered by other drivers when you are at fault. Compulsory in Georgia, Arizona, and Utah.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers all expenses related to damage of another person’s property when you are at fault. Compulsory in Georgia, Arizona, and Utah.

**Collision.** Covers expenses related to vehicle repair and replacement if your vehicle is damaged in a collision, regardless of who was at fault. This coverage is voluntary.

**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement if your vehicle suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal. This coverage is voluntary.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Covers medical and rehabilitation expenses, and in some cases lost wages for you and any other passengers, no matter who was at fault. Compulsory in Utah, voluntary in Georgia and Arizona.

**Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist.** Covers the other driver’s liabilities if they are uninsured or underinsured. This type of coverage is voluntary.

## Additional Features

As mentioned, Freedom National goes to great lengths to offer more than just the standard bare bones policy. Customers get the option of adding any number of add-ons to their policy, including the following.

**Rental car reimbursement.** Covers the cost of renting a vehicle while your car is being repaired or replaced due to a covered loss.

**Towing.** Covers the expense of towing or repairs at the place of disablement.

**Emergency roadside service.** Ensures you get speedy assistance whenever your car breaks down and you need a tire replacement, lock in, other emergency service.

**Discounts.** Freedom National offers a range of discount opportunities, including a good driver discount for applicants without any recent claims.

## How to Apply

The process of applying to Freedom National is more or less the same as you’ll find with other insurance carriers. Although there are different agents specializing in Georgia, Arizona, and Utah, the process of applying is pretty much the same – no matter which of the three states you live and drive in. Applications can be made online or by phone.
Before applying to Freedom National, we recommend preparing the following information:

- Driver information (for you and any other drivers on the policy).
- Vehicle information (including make, model, year, and mileage).
  Driving history (includes any claims or reported incidents involving you or co-policyholders).
- Any other details that could strengthen your case for a lower rate or help you qualify for a discount (such as good driving behavior)

## Filing a Claim

Freedom National has separate claims departments for Georgia, Arizona, and Utah. This is a good thing, because claims can work quite differently in different states. For example, Utah is one of 12 “no-fault” states where policyholders may file make a claim with their own insurance provider, regardless of whether they or another driver was at fault. Georgia and Arizona are both among the majority of “fault” states, where claims must be filed with the at-fault driver’s insurance company.
One downside to Freedom National’s service is that it doesn’t accept claims online. The only method of filing a claim is to call Freedom National’s customer service department during business hours to be directed to the correct claims department for your state.

## Contact Details

Overall, Freedom National offers good customer service, with the one weakness being that it only operates Monday through Friday during regular business hours. With that said, Freedom National’s agents are always helpful and have enough knowledge to direct you toward the right policy for your driving habits and needs. Customer support is also offered in Spanish.

## Summary

Whenever you purchase car insurance, you really get two types of carrier to choose from: a big carrier with national reach; or a small carrier with deep local knowledge. Freedom National undoubtedly fits the latter description, given its expertise in providing car insurance to residents of Georgia, Arizona, and Utah for more than 20 years. Freedom National’s agents are welluipped to help find the best policy for your needs, at a competitive price. If you live in Freedom National’s coverage area and are looking to buy new vehicle coverage or switch from your old provider, you could do worse than request a quote from Freedom National.
