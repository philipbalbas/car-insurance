## In a Nutshell

Compare.com is a free online platform that allows users to compare and purchase policies from more than 50 of the best auto insurance companies in the United States. It serves users in all 50 states and DC and displays the best rates and policies depending on the user’s location, vehicle, and other personal details.

## Pros and Cons

The most obvious benefit to using Compare.com is that it allows you to compare dozens of car insurance providers with just one quick online form. With Compare.com, there’s no longer any need to leave your house or spend more than 5 minutes of your valuable time in order to find the best car insurance provider and policies. Unlike some other insurance marketplaces, Compare.com won’t share your contact details with dozens of agents. Instead, it lets you decide which policy you like best – and redirects you straight to your chosen insurance provider to complete the application.

There aren’t any obvious downsides to Compare.com’s free service but it’s important to be aware that Compare.com doesn’t directly provide any insurance products. You’ll start the process on the Compare.com website but finish it with your chosen insurance company.

## Types of Auto Insurance

Compare.com can set you up with companies offering the following types of car insurance coverage:

**Collision coverage.** Covers expenses for vehicle damage or destruction, regardless of who was at fault.

**Comprehensive coverage.** Covers expenses for damages not related to vehicle collisions, such as theft, vandalism, and weather events.

**Liability coverage.** Covers expenses related to injury, death or property damage in situations where the policyholder is at fault. In most states, drivers are legally required to purchase bodily injury liability and property damage liability.

**Personal injury protection.** Covers expenses related to injuries you or your passengers suffer as a result of a vehicle accident, e.g. medical costs, income loss, childcare.
