## In a Nutshell

Assurance IQ is an insurance agency and marketplace from the world of hi-tech that sells auto, home, health, and life insurance. It uses data science and licensed agents to match users with custom plans from top insurance carriers. Assurance was founded in 2016. In 2019, it was acquired by Prudential Financial for the hefty sum of \$2.35 billion. Assurance continues to operate as a separate division of Prudential focused on custom insurance plans.

## Pros and Cons

**Pro:** The technology behind Assurance must be amazing if Prudential Financial was willing to pay \$2.35 billion for it (making Assurance the eight-fastest tech startup in history to get to a billion-dollar exit). And indeed the tech is great: through a combination of data science and real licensed agents, Assurance tailors auto insurance to suit your needs. That means no more overloading you with coverage you don’t need and don’t want to pay for; with Assurance, all you get is the right coverage for you.

**Con:** It’s unclear how exactly the recent acquisition by Prudential Financial will affect Assurance, if at all. With that said, it appears that things will generally stay the same and that Assurance will continue to offer the same great service it was offering before the deal went through. For now, all we know is that as part of the deal, Prudential plans will be offered alongside other insurance carriers on the Assurance platform.

## Types of Auto Insurance

More than other insurance marketplaces, Assurance has the technology to ensure you only get the types of coverage you need. It can build any of the following standard types of coverage into your policy, should there be a need.

**Bodily Injury Liability.** Covers all expenses related to bodily injuries suffered by other drivers when you are at fault.

**Property Damage Liability.** Covers all expenses related to damage of another person’s property when you are at fault.

**Collision.** Covers expenses related to vehicle repair and replacement if your vehicle is damaged in a collision, regardless of who was at fault.

**Comprehensive.** Covers repairs and replacement if your vehicle suffers damage in a non-collision incident such as fire, flood, vandalism, theft, or hitting an animal.

**Personal Injury Protection.** Covers medical and rehabilitation expenses, and in some cases lost wages for you and any other passengers, no matter who was at fault.

**Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist.** Covers the other driver’s liabilities if they are uninsured or underinsured.

## Additional Features

Awesome technology aside, Assurance is similar to other auto insurance agencies in that it works with a range of top insurance carriers, forcing the carriers to compete for customers by offering lower prices and better features. Following are some of the features you can expect to find through Assurance’s partners.

**Gap coverage.** If your car suffers a total loss, this covers the gap between the depreciated value and what you still owe.

**Rental reimbursement.** If your car is in the shop due to a covered accident, this covers the cost of renting a temporary replacement.

**Roadside assistance.** If you’re stuck out on the interstate or the back roads, this guarantees you quick emergency assistance.

**Rideshare coverage.** For people who use their vehicle for work with ridesharing platforms like Uber, this provides coverage.

## How to Apply

Assurance exists to offer personalized insurance. The application process begins with a few questions about you and your needs. From there, Assurance’s proprietary platform takes over, analyzing the thousands of data points that make you unique. This allows it to create a custom, tailored plan for you that fits your unique needs and budget.

According to Assurance, most applications are completed within 24 hours. Applications begin online or over the phone, and you can ask to speak to one of Assurance’s remote licensed agents at any time to get one-on-one help. In other words, the tech optimizes Assurance’s service, but you get the benefit of a human element as well. When you apply online, you get the benefit of seeing a progress tracker at the top of the screen that shows you the percentage of the online form that you’ve already completed.

Assurance always recommends you start with a digital application to determine the right coverage and price. From there you can complete the application digitally or consult with an expert licensed agent.

In order to apply to Assurance, you’ll need to provide your name and contact details and answer the following questions:

- Do you have car insurance?

- How many drivers do you want to insure?

- Vehicle types (year, make, model, trim)

- Have you had any accidents, tickets, or DUIs in the past 3 years?

- Do you need an SR-22?

- Are you married?

- Are you a homeowner?

- Do you or any of your relatives serve in the military?

## Filing a Claim

The Assurance website doesn’t provide any information whatsoever about the claims process. Because Assurance acts as something of a hybrid between an agency and a marketplace, the claims process presumably goes through your insurance carrier. If you get the chance to speak to an Assurance licensed agent, we recommend asking them about the claims process before you go ahead and sign with a carrier.

## Contact Details

In addition to its online platform, Assurance offers the option of speaking to a licensed agent at any time. Agents appear to be available during extended business hours. The phone number is 844-908-9730. According to Assurance, once you are an customer, Assurance gives you a lifetime commitment to help you with any questions you might have or modify your coverage as your needs change.

## Summary

Data science has been making life easier for consumers in all sorts of ways, but it’s taken a while for it to crack the insurance industry. Thanks to Assurance, the latest technologies are now being introduced to auto insurance, which has the effect of giving each customer a tailored plan to suit their unique needs and budget.
