# Quote Wizard Review

## In a Nutshell

QuoteWizard is a free online tool that allows users to compare policies and rates from many of the best auto insurance companies. It takes only a few minutes to complete the online form and see a price comparison that it would take you hours to do if you were left to request prices from each company on your own.

## Pros and Cons

Pro: The most obvious pro of using QuoteWizard is that it allows you to select the best rate from its network of partnering insurance companies. All you have to do is fill out one quick online form to pre-qualify for auto insurance from a range of car insurance companies. And best of all, you don’t even need to enter any sensitive information such as social security number of vehicle identification number to see a quote – a few basic details about yourself and your vehicle will suffice.

Con: QuoteWizard’s service can save you time and energy. However, you should be aware that by entering your contact details to get a quote, you can expect to get calls and/or emails from partnering insurance companies. This could be a pro or con, really: on the one hand, it can be annoying getting several calls during the workday; but on the other, each of these insurance companies is pitching for you to become a customer – and the more competition, the lower the rates.
